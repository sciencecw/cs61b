1 F In an unbalanced tree this is not true
2 F The upper bound could be N
3 F The lower bound could be as fast as logN in a balanced tree
4 T It cannot be slower than linear time even if the tree is completely unbalanced
5 T since 4 is true this immediately follows
6 F insert alone takes 2lnN
7 F they could be both close to the top of the tree
8 O(N^2)
