Basic Storage Design Plan for Gitlet


Overview
-------

The neccesary files are contained in .gitlet. There is a State.ser file which 
records the information about previous commits and related file location
Also, there are folders named with the commit IDs which contains the minimal
and neccesary copies of files  


Sequential Example
-------

For each of the commands below, describe in detail what files on your computer change after the command is executed. Only list changes made to files. Do not list details regarding the reading of files.

$ java Gitlet init

	. If it does not already exist, a new folder called .gitlet is created in the current directory.
	. A new serializable State object is created and stored in .gitlet/state.ser, which includes three variables
		1.	addSet: address of the staged files (empty initially)
		2.	commitTree: a tree/ branching linked-list containing commit dates, message and filenames 
			(containing only commit zero with no files)
		3.	headPointer: a map pointing at end of branches as well as HEAD

$ java Gitlet add dog.txt

	. Check if the file has been changed after the last commit in which the file is added
	. Store file address at variable addSet in State object


$ java Gitlet commit “initial commit of dog.txt”

	. create folder named with the ID of the commit in .gitlet
	. copy added files into folder
	. add commit node to commitTree object
	. clear addSet


$ java Gitlet add dog.txt

	. Gitlet checks the timestamp of the last commit in which dog.txt exists and compares it to last modified date
	. Since the last modified precedes time of last commit, Gitlet does nothing and displays error message


$ cp manyDogs.txt dog.txt
$ java Gitlet add dog.txt

	. Gitlet checks the timestamp of the last commit in which dog.txt exists and compares it to last modified date
	. Since the last modified comes after time of last commit, Gitlet adds the address to addSet

$ java Gitlet commit “replaced dog.txt with manyDogs”

	. Gitlet creates a new folder with ID 2 in .getlet
	. copies added files into folder
	. add commit node to commitTree object
	. clear addSet

$ java Gitlet add manyDogs.txt

	. the address is added to addSet


$ java Gitlet add ketchupFriend.txt

	. the address is added to addSet

$ java Gitlet commit “added manyDogs and ketchupFriend”

	. Gitlet creates a new folder with ID 3 in .getlet
	. copies added files into folder
	. add commit node to commitTree object with new timestamp
	. clear addSet


$ java Gitlet commit YOLO

	. addSet is empty, so no commit happens

$ cp doge.txt manyDogs.txt
$ java Gitlet add manyDogs.txt

	. manydogs.txt is added to addSet

$ java Gitlet commit “replaced manyDogs with doge”

	. Gitlet creates a new folder with ID 4 in .getlet
	. copies added manyDogs.txt into folder
	. add commit node to commitTree object with new timestamp
	. clear addSet

$ java Gitlet add dog.txt

	. dog.txt is added to addSet

$ java Gitlet commit “added dog yet again”

	. Gitlet creates a new folder with ID 5 in .getlet
	. copies added Dogs.txt into folder
	. add commit node to commitTree object with new timestamp
	. clear addSet
